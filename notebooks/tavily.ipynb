however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]', 'score': 0.75797355, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'Lionel Messi Stats, Goals, Records, Assists, Cups and more - FBref.com', 'url': 'https://fbref.com/en/players/d70ce98e/Lionel-Messi', 'content': 'Match Logs (Miscellaneous Stats)\\nGoal Logs by Competition\\nScouting Report\\nInter Miami(9-7-18, 27th place in Major League Soccer)\\nRoster\\nShow entire roster\\nArgentina\\nRoster\\nShow entire roster\\nOn this page:\\nLionel Messi Scouting Report\\nLionel Messi Scouting Report\\nSimilar Players to Lionel Messi\\nSimilar Players to Lionel Messi\\nLast 5 Matches\\nMore:\\nMatch Logs\\n•\\nGoal Logs\\nPlayer News\\nStandard Stats: Domestic Leagues\\nShooting: Domestic Leagues\\nPassing: Domestic Leagues\\nPass Types: Domestic Leagues\\nGoal and Shot Creation: Domestic Leagues\\nDefensive Actions: Domestic Leagues\\nPossession: Domestic Leagues\\nPlaying Time: Instagram:\\n@leomessi\\nMLS\\n6\\n373\\n1\\n2\\n2.6\\n2.6\\n1.4\\n27\\n3\\n* see our coverage note\\nPlayer Comparison\\nStats by Competition\\nMatch Logs (Summary)\\nMatch Logs (Passing)\\nMatch Logs (Pass Types)\\nMatch Logs (Goal and Shot Creation)\\n Lionel Messi\\nLionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini\\nPosition: FW-MF (AM-WM)\\xa0▪\\xa0 Footed: Left\\n170cm,\\xa072kg\\xa0(5-6½,\\xa0159lb)\\nBorn:\\nJune 24, 1987\\nin Rosario, Argentina\\nar\\nNational Team:\\xa0Argentina ar\\nClub: Inter Miami\\nWages:\\n$12,000,000 Annual\\nExpires December 2025.
